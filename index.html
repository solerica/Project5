    <h4>Who is Erica?</h4>
          <p>I was born in Fres√±o, CA and moved to Phoenix, AZ at the age of 5. I've been married for 10 years and I'm a mother of 3 kids. I never had a stable place to call "home" I moved around different cities in Arizona quite a few times but, when the day comes I want to be able to have my own plot of land to be able to grow my own food and raise stock.</p>
          <p>I currently work for Amazon GYR2 and, been with the company for 5years. I promoted to a process assistant for night shift on May 12, 2022. I run my own department called "Inbound Fluid" and manage 20 associates Sunday to Wednesday. I make sure my team is following safety protocols and follow the instructions to get the job done the right way.Throughout the night I keep track of the work flow and total volume of our goal numbers of the night to be able to report to my managers. When things get complicated my job there is to report it to the managers to have the proper escalating procedure and they can take initiative actions. Being a leader has helped me develope communication skills to be able to help other people in their careers/job opportunity. I was successful having 5 of my assocates move up within the company! That to me will always be an accomplishment.</p>

      <h4>The Journey Awaits Me!</h4>
          <p>Since the first day I enrolled to the program for "Software Development" I knew I made the right call. It amazes me when I first saw it, it was a bunch of letters and numbers that looked like a hot mess but, it makes something so simple to look it once done. I learned HMTL CSS and different ways to make page lay outs, one of the things that caught my attention way the "making everything beautiful." I love organzing, using colors and fun backgrounds to make the pages come to life for the client or personal use.  One of my biggest goals to accomplish with this program is to be able to create my own moblie games.</p>
